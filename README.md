# Valkyrie CI system
The Valkyrie CI system is a small [Lapis](http://leafo.net/lapis/) application that is invoked when the [Valkyrie Framework repository](https://github.com/ValkyrieRBXL/ValkyrieFramework) sends a push event through GitHub webhooks.

When invoked, Valkyrie CI will attempt to pull/clone the changes, compile them into an Roblox RBXM model and upload it to Roblox. Here's [a list](http://gskw.noip.me:9999/models) of uploaded models' IDs.
